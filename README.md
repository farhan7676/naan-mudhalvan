#      Project: Urban Planning and Design

This project introduces a complete and modular AI-Powered Urban Planning and Design System to enable smart, data-based decisions in the development of cities, with a specific usage around Aalim College. The system simulates sophisticated urban infrastructures like buildings, roads, zones, and IoT sensors within an integrated and expandable Python environment. It is a core utility for smart city simulation, analysis, and future planning.

##      Features – Key Functionalities:

   -   Modular Urban Plan Modeling: Develop and maintain urban plans with buildings, roads, zones, and sensors.
   -   Dynamic Zoning: Multiple zone types and building-zone associations support.
   -   IoT Sensor Integration: Emulate real-time monitoring with virtual environmental sensors.
   -   Geospatial Intelligence: Calculate distance and area based on geographic coordinates.

##      Technology Used – Languages, Tools, and Libraries
   *Programming Language*: Python 3.11+

---

##      Libraries & Tools:

   -   uuid, datetime, enum, typing, and json for core functionality and serialization
   Object-oriented design principles for modularity and extensibility

---

##      How It Works – Project Workflow:
   
   -   Plan Creation: Start a new city plan with name and description.
   -   Zone Definition: Create zones as polygon boundaries and define zone types.
   -   Building & Road Integration: Insert buildings and roads with geometries and attributes.
   -   Sensor Deployment: Deploy the IoT sensors with coordinates and input data.
   -   Demonstration Script: Auto-runs a smart city demo around Aalim College.
